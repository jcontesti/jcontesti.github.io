Hello, world! 

My name is Jordi Contest√≠, and I live on the lovely island of Mallorca, Spain. 

Currently, I am the Head of Data at habitissimo, where I am responsible for Data Science
 and Data Engineering projects. I hold an MSc in Computer Science and another in 
 Business Intelligence and Big Data.

I consider myself a lifelong learner: always wanting to learn new things! Right now, I 
am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Software Engineering.
