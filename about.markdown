Hello, World! 

My name is Jordi Contest√≠, and I live on the lovely island of Mallorca, Spain. 

I hold one MSc in Computer Science and another in Business Intelligence and Big Data. 
Currently, I am the Head of Data at [habitissimo], where I am responsible for Data Science and Data Engineering projects.

I consider myself a [lifelong learner]: always wanting to learn new things. Right now, 
I am profoundly interested in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Data 
Engineering. Knowing everything about these significant areas has become an obsession 
to me!

You can expect articles and personal opinions about all these topics on this website, 
but I am open to writing about any topic. 

This site is written in English, although I can speak Catalan and Spanish as native 
languages and I studied German and French years ago.

Would you like to get in contact with me? Please, send me a message via 
[my page at LinkedIn].
