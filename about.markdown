[Hello, World!]

My name is Jordi Contest√≠, and I live on the lovely island of Mallorca, Spain. 

I hold an MSc in Computer Engineering and another in Business Intelligence and Big Data.

I have a deep passion for programming, statistics and data. I consider myself a [lifelong learner], always eager to explore new ideas and technologies.
